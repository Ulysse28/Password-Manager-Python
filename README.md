This is a Password Manager made in Python with PyQt5.

The app is linked to a database where the crypted passwords are stored.
Each password is linked to a name (a website name, an application name, anything actually).

To access the real password, we need a key. The key can be any number.

The "Security level" is how many time the password will pass through the crypting algorithm. It can be any positive number.

I did it for fun ;)
